# Facial Emotion Recognition (HOG + SVM)

This repository contains the implementation of a facial emotion recognition system that classifies facial expressions using traditional machine learning techniques rather than deep learning methods.

## Approach

The project follows a classic computer vision pipeline:

- Face detection using Haar cascade classifiers
- Feature extraction using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)
- Emotion classification using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with an RBF kernel

## Datasets

- **JAFFE**
- **CK (Cohn–Kanade)**
